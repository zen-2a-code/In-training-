I have a long way to go, here are the projects that are worth uploading. 
This project is a baby, but it took me a lot of time to do.
It uses the .png files for the folder to display the card so you must extract them and leave the .py file in the same location as the folder "cards_png".
There is still much to do here, but it was must first big project it was really painful, but also joyfull when succeeding. I learn a lot from this project, but it only showed me how little I really new.
Remark: This project is made without creating a new objects I haven't covered that yet, but it is the next thing that I will do.
